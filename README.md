# My C++ Algorithms Repository

This repository contains algorithms that I implemented while following the roadmap of Dr. Abu Hadhoud.  

I started this learning journey a couple of years ago, going through 6 different levels. Some of them included OOP applications and building small libraries, all done in C++. I also worked on data structures, rewriting them myself without relying on built-in functions from modern languages. This repository reflects my hands-on practice and my learning path in C++.

## What you will find here
- Classic algorithms implemented in C++
- OOP applications and small C++ libraries created by me
- Data structures implemented from scratch
- My personal notes and examples of problem-solving exercises

## Note
These codes were written during my early learning phase, so some implementations may not be optimized or follow advanced best practices. They are a reflection of my growth as a developer.
