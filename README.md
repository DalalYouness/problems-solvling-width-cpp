# My C++ Algorithms Repository

This repository contains algorithms that I implemented while following the roadmap of Dr. Abu Hadhoud.  

Although these exercises are old and were not shared before, I am adding them now to **document my learning path and show how I started** in C++ and Problem Solving. I started with Functional Programming and then moved to OOP, going through 6 different levels in total. Some levels included building small libraries, all done in C++. I also worked on data structures, rewriting them myself without relying on built-in functions from modern languages. I followed this learning path for approximately 2 years. For each course I completed, I earned a certification in C++ and Problem Solving. This repository reflects my hands-on practice and my learning journey.

## What you will find here
- Classic algorithms implemented in C++
- Functional Programming and OOP applications
- Small C++ libraries created by me
- Data structures implemented from scratch
- My personal notes and examples of problem-solving exercises
- Certifications for each completed course in C++ and Problem Solving

## Note
These codes were written during my early learning phase, so some implementations may not be optimized or follow advanced best practices. They are a reflection of my growth as a developer.
